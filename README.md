Simple G-Code Generators
========================

This repository contains a collection of Python scrips that generate simple G-Code for LinuxCNC. For me to fire up a high dollar CAD program and the use the POST processor to generate simple routines is a waste of time. So I'm writing a series of Python programs to do this. If you did an LinuxCNC install, or have Mac OS X, you already have all you need. 

You can either close this repository using Git or download the whole repo as [a zip file](https://github.com/njh/simple-gcode-generators/archive/master.zip).
